# Color Jump

Basic WebGL Game - https://apps.facebook.com/colorjumpgame/

To build

```
bower install
npm install
./package.sh
```

You'll then see a directory appear called _build_output_ - that should contain all the files you need to run it on your webserver. For a quick test, you can use the built-in PHP webserver:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Known Problems

* Collision detection could be more precise
* Game is too difficult
* Menu system in-complete and could look a lot nicer
* No sound
